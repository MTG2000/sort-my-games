**Can you tell me more about this smart algorithm?**

**What's the story behind SortMyGames?**
SortMyGames started as a personal project out of frustration with having a massive games list and nowhere sensible to put new entries. After showing it to some friends who loved it, I polished and refined the concept, and decided to share it with all of you since it seemed to be a common pain!

The sky's the limit here! The algorithm handles even gigantic lists without breaking a sweat. Only 10 comparisons are needed for a list of 1000 games!
