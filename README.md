# Smart Video Games Rater
An app that allows you to create a sorted list of games & order them smartly with minimal efforts.
If you have a list of 1000 games & you want to add a new one but not sure where exactly, we will ask you to compare it against at MAXIMUM 10 other games, & we will figure out the exact place it should be in!

## What can I use this for?
Well, I personally created it to more easily navigate through my backlog of games I want to play.
But you can do that for:
- Your top 10 games of all time
- Top games you want to buy
- Top games you want to play next
Whatever you want.
