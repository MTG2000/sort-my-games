Sure thing! You have all the normal sorting options like drag-&-drop or moving items up and down the list. Our smart algorithm will recalibrate and maintain the overall integrity of your list.

### **How does the items comparison work?**

When the smart algorithm needs to compare 2 items in a list, it's like setting up a duel. Two games/books/movies. One choice. You decide which comes first! Based on your selection, our algorithm shrinks the search area, ultimately unearthing the sweet spot for your item.

### **Is there a limit to my items list?**

### **Why is the sharing url so long and ugly?!**

Since we don't store any data on our servers, the URL must contain all the necessary data needed to recreate your list on someone else's device. However, if you really want to have a shorter URL, you can use a URL shortening service like bit.ly or TinyURL.
